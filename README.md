# PHP Silent Failure: Undefined Array Keys

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, issue in PHP: the silent failure that occurs when accessing undefined array keys.  Unlike languages that throw exceptions or errors for this scenario, PHP simply returns `null`, potentially masking bugs and causing unexpected behavior.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version, emphasizing the importance of using `isset()` or other error handling techniques before accessing array elements.

This is a critical issue for developers to understand to avoid hidden bugs and improve code robustness.
