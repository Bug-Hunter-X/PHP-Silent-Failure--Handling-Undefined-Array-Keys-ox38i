In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[123] = "value2";

echo count($myArray); // Outputs 2

//Attempting to access a non-existent key
if (isset($myArray["key2"])) {
    echo $myArray["key2"];
} else {
    echo "Key 'key2' does not exist";
}

//However, this will output an error if "key2" is not defined and not an integer key
$value = $myArray["key2"];
```

If you attempt to directly access a non-existent key (like `$myArray["key2"]` in the example where it's not set) without first checking with `isset()`, PHP will not throw a warning, instead returning a null value, which can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures down the line.  The difference is highlighted; using `isset` produces different output.

This is different from accessing an array index using an integer that is out of bounds, which throws a warning (though a better practice is checking for the key).

Another example:
```php
function myFunc($data) {
    return $data['key'];
}

$data = ['anotherkey' => 'value'];

$result = myFunc($data);
//Notice this doesn't throw an error, it just returns NULL
var_dump($result);
```
